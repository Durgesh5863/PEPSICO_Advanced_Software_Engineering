# Augur: Predictive Supply Chain Management System Design

## Overview
Augur is a predictive supply chain management system designed to provide PepsiCo with real-time insights into distributor shipment data and forecasts. The system features a browser-based dashboard that displays key metrics for each distributor, helping supply chain managers make informed decisions.

## System Requirements

1. Browser-based dashboard for users
2. Dashboard metrics for each distributor:
   - Name
   - Year-to-date average quantity of goods shipped
   - Quantity of goods shipped last month
   - Forecasted quantity of goods to ship this month
3. Integration with existing predictive shipping pipeline via messaging queues
4. Deployment to Azure
5. Emphasis on extensibility for future growth

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The Augur system will be built using a microservices architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend Layer**
   - Dashboard UI (React/Angular SPA)
   - Authentication & Authorization
   - Data Visualization Components

2. **API Gateway**
   - Request routing
   - API versioning
   - Rate limiting
   - Authentication validation

3. **Backend Services**
   - Distributor Service
   - Metrics Service
   - Forecast Service
   - Data Processing Service

4. **Data Layer**
   - Azure Cosmos DB (for distributor data)
   - Azure Blob Storage (for historical data)
   - Azure Cache for Redis (for performance optimization)

5. **Integration Layer**
   - Azure Service Bus (for message queue integration)
   - Event Hub (for real-time data processing)

6. **Monitoring & DevOps**
   - Azure Monitor
   - Application Insights
   - Azure DevOps for CI/CD

### Component Details

#### Frontend Layer
- **Dashboard UI**: A single-page application built with React or Angular that provides an intuitive interface for users to view distributor metrics.
- **Authentication**: Integration with Azure Active Directory for secure user authentication.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs using libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to display shipment data and forecasts.

#### API Gateway
- Acts as a single entry point for all client requests
- Handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and request routing
- Implemented using Azure API Management

#### Backend Services
- **Distributor Service**: Manages distributor information and metadata
- **Metrics Service**: Calculates and provides access to historical shipment metrics
- **Forecast Service**: Processes and serves forecast data from the predictive shipping pipeline
- **Data Processing Service**: Handles ETL operations and data transformations

#### Data Layer
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: NoSQL database for storing distributor profiles and metrics
- **Azure Blob Storage**: For storing large volumes of historical shipment data
- **Azure Cache for Redis**: For caching frequently accessed data to improve performance

#### Integration Layer
- **Azure Service Bus**: Connects to existing messaging queues to receive shipment data and forecasts
- **Event Hub**: Processes real-time data streams for immediate dashboard updates

#### Monitoring & DevOps
- **Azure Monitor**: For system health monitoring and alerting
- **Application Insights**: For application performance monitoring
- **Azure DevOps**: For CI/CD pipeline management

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Shipment data and forecasts are received from the existing predictive shipping pipeline via Azure Service Bus
   - Data Processing Service validates, transforms, and enriches the incoming data

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Processed data is stored in appropriate data stores (Cosmos DB for current metrics, Blob Storage for historical data)
   - Frequently accessed data is cached in Redis for performance

3. **API Access**:
   - Backend services expose RESTful APIs to access the processed data
   - API Gateway routes client requests to appropriate backend services

4. **Frontend Display**:
   - Dashboard UI fetches data from backend services via the API Gateway
   - Data is displayed using interactive visualizations
   - Users can filter, sort, and drill down into the data

## Extensibility Considerations

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Allows for independent scaling and development of individual components
2. **API Versioning**: Ensures backward compatibility as new features are added
3. **Event-Driven Design**: Facilitates adding new consumers of data events without modifying existing components
4. **Containerization**: Using Azure Kubernetes Service for easy deployment and scaling of services
5. **Feature Flagging**: Implementation of feature flags to gradually roll out new functionality

## Azure Deployment

- **Frontend**: Azure Static Web Apps or Azure App Service
- **API Gateway**: Azure API Management
- **Backend Services**: Azure Kubernetes Service or Azure App Service
- **Databases**: Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Cache for Redis
- **Integration**: Azure Service Bus, Event Hub
- **Monitoring**: Azure Monitor, Application Insights
- **DevOps**: Azure DevOps for CI/CD

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Azure Active Directory integration
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. **Data Encryption**: Encryption at rest and in transit
4. **Network Security**: Virtual Network integration and Network Security Groups
5. **Secrets Management**: Azure Key Vault for storing secrets and certificates

## Future Expansion Possibilities

1. **Advanced Analytics**: Integration with Azure Machine Learning for enhanced forecasting
2. **Mobile App**: Development of a companion mobile application
3. **Supplier Portal**: Extension to include supplier-facing features
4. **Inventory Optimization**: Additional modules for inventory management
5. **Global Expansion**: Multi-region deployment for global operations
