# Augur Engineering Tickets

This directory contains the engineering tickets for the Augur Predictive Supply Chain Management System. The tickets are organized into epics that cover all aspects of the system implementation as described in the system design document.

## Overview

The engineering tickets are structured to guide the development team through building the Augur system. They are organized into the following epics:

1. **Project Setup and Infrastructure**: Initial setup of the project repository, Azure resources, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring infrastructure.

2. **Frontend Development**: Implementation of the browser-based dashboard, including authentication, layout, distributor views, and data visualization components.

3. **API Gateway**: Setup and configuration of the API Gateway to route requests to backend services.

4. **Backend Services**: Implementation of the microservices that power the Augur system, including the Distributor Service, Metrics Service, Forecast Service, and Data Processing Service.

5. **Data Layer**: Implementation of the data access layer for Cosmos DB, Blob Storage, and Redis Cache.

6. **Integration Layer**: Integration with Azure Service Bus and Event Hub for data ingestion and real-time processing.

7. **Security Implementation**: Implementation of data encryption, Key Vault integration, and network security.

8. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Implementation of integration tests, load tests, and end-to-end tests.

9. **Deployment and Operations**: Configuration of Kubernetes deployments, environment configuration, and disaster recovery planning.

10. **User Documentation and Training**: Creation of user and admin documentation, as well as training materials.

## Ticket Structure

Each ticket includes the following information:

- **Type**: User Story or Technical Task
- **Story Points**: Estimate of effort required
- **Priority**: High, Medium, or Low
- **Description**: Brief description of the work to be done
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific criteria that must be met for the ticket to be considered complete

## First Sprint Planning

For the first sprint, the following tickets are recommended:

- Ticket 1.1: Project Repository Setup
- Ticket 1.2: Azure Resource Provisioning
- Ticket 1.3: CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- Ticket 2.1: Frontend Project Scaffolding
- Ticket 3.1: API Gateway Setup
- Ticket 4.1: Backend Service Architecture
- Ticket 5.1: Database Schema Design

These tickets establish the foundation for the Augur system and enable parallel development of the frontend and backend components.
